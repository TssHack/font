  // - Sans-serif bold italic (𝙖)

  // Enclosed CJK Letters and Months (U+3200–U+32FF) has some parenthesized, circled letters.
  // Squared KG Characters (U+3300 - U+33FF) - mostly CJK.
  // Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement (U+1F100–U+1F1FF) - more enclosed, mostly uppercase.
  // Squared Latin letters (U+1F1E6 - U+1F1FF for regional indicators, but also other squared like 🄰).
